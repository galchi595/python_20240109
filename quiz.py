The political rally held on Saturday for the Kuomintang's (KMT) candidate for the 13 January presidential election was in full swing.
"Give me a president!" shouted the host. "Hou You-ih!" the crowd roared.
As Mr Hou looked on, his running mate Jaw Shaw-kong took the microphone and launched a broadside against the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
